*This is work in progress.*


List of algorithms
------------------

* Levenshtein distance and similarity
* Hirshberg's string alignment

For all the algorithms there are simple to use command line utilities.


Build and installation
----------------------

You need C\++ compiler with support for C++11.
Recent enough gcc (4.9) or newer is OK.
You also need cmake and make.

On Debian-based systems, the following should get the above:
----
# apt-get install g++ cmake make git
----

Clone the project:
----
$ git clone https://github.com/vencik/algorithm.git
----

Build the project:
----
$ cd algorithm
$ ./build.sh
----
